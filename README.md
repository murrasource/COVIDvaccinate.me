Note: This project is now in archived mode. For the most up-to-date vaccination locations, please visit the [official U.S. vaccination site](https://www.vaccines.gov/).

COVIDvaccinate.me is an open-source project that aggregates COVID-19 vaccination appointment information across the entire United States. The user interface requires minimal interaction, allowing the most vulnerable to COVID-19 (such as the elderly who tend to be less proficient in digital technologies) to more easily get vaccinated. Additionally, daily emails are sent with personalized vaccine information.

This project began as an individual effort, but it has now become associated with [StatMN](https://statmn.org), a non-profit organization based in Minnesota that seeks to address healthcare inequities and respond to regional medical crises.

A special thanks to the [Vaccine Spotter API](https://www.vaccinespotter.org), which is used in this project.
